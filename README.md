# Computer Vision

Computer Vision (CV) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to **see, understand, and interpret visual information** from images and videos.  
It allows machines to analyze visual data similarly to how humans perceive the world.

Computer Vision combines **image processing, machine learning, and deep learning** techniques to extract meaningful information from digital images and videos.

## What Computer Vision Does

Computer Vision systems can:

- Detect objects in images or videos
- Recognize faces and expressions
- Read text from images (OCR)
- Analyze medical images (X-ray, MRI)
- Support autonomous vehicles
- Enhance and restore images

## Core Tasks in Computer Vision

### Image Processing  
Basic operations on images such as:
- Brightness & contrast adjustment
- Filtering (blur, sharpen)
- Edge detection
- Color space conversion (RGB, HSV, LAB)

### Image Classification  
Assigning a label to an image (e.g., cat, dog, car).

### Object Detection  
Identifying and locating objects within an image or video.

### Image Segmentation  
Dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects.

### Feature Extraction  
Detecting important features such as edges, corners, and textures.
